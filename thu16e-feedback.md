## LATE SUBMISSION (SEE GIT LOG)
## Tutor Comment
Overall, great attempt! I really liked the way you have implemented your code in a clear and concise manner. Here
are a few suggestions: -
1. I liked the timer functionality as a potential extension for the game. However, when I click the `pause` button, it seems
to break the game, and I am unable to return back (let me know in case this is not the case).
2. Might need to improve the invalid placements so that the piece returns back to the menu in case of an invalid placement.
3. I really liked the overall design of the game and the engaging color scheme. Well done on that!
4. While playing the game, I found it a bit harder to play on laptop as all the operations are mouse-operations.
   It might have been a good idea to use the keyboard as well (for instance - using the `r` key on keyboard to rotate the piece
   than using right clicks.)
5. When the player completes the game, it might be a good idea to show the congrats menu ;). 
6. When implementing the `hint` functionality, it might be good if firstly all the incorrect placements are removed from the board
   and then the `hint` is shown.
   
Overall very nice work! I really enjoyed playing it. :)

    comment: I got ideas of cube coordinates from this website. I think the
      properties of cube coordinates are useful for this assignment design.
      And I promise I will not use the code on this website for this
      assignment.
