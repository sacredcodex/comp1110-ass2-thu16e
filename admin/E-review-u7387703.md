### Comments 

This method draw the stars which consist of pieces.I think the biggest feature of this code is precision, can accurately draw and board suitable 
star graphics.This code is also well documented and its structure is appropriate.Both method and variable names follow the specification, and the coding style is consistent to other parts in Star class.It helps us to create piece in gui as well.
